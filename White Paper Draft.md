Authors: Quellaran Deluxethue Messat (Specter Interface)

Abstract:
We present a mathematical framework that unifies convex 4-polytopes (e.g., the 5-cell, 600-cell) and embedded spherical constructs to create an entropy engine capable of generating infinite, non-repeating randomness. By leveraging the topological behavior of tetrahedral boundaries and radial transformations, the resulting algorithm performs geometric rotations and molecular unfoldings to generate a theoretically unbounded entropy stream. This paper defines the theoretical constructs, provides mathematical models, and outlines potential applications in cryptography, simulation, and GhostCore-based temporal encoding.

1. Introduction

We hypothesize that true randomness can be derived from geometric and topological constraints, rather than conventional pseudorandom functions. Inspired by polychora (4D convex regular polytopes) and embedded spheres (representing compressed state or entropy nodes), we outline a dynamic model capable of recursively generating non-deterministic outputs.

2. Foundations

Let:

 be the 4-polytope, specifically a 5-cell () with 5 tetrahedral cells.

 be a sphere of radius , fully enclosed within each tetrahedral cell .

 be the shortest and longest inter-surface distances between spheres  and the tetrahedral faces of .

3. Fold/Unfold Mapping

Each  is initialized in a compressed (folded) state:



The unfolding function  restores  to an expanded spatial configuration:



This process defines a rotation key  where:



The value  is a vector magnitude determining the transformation space.

4. Entropy Generation

Let entropy output  be derived as:



Where:

 is a hashing or nonlinear transformation function

 represent angular displacements during rotation

 is a temporal or iterative variable

The system is recursive:



where  is the total number of tetrahedral cells used in sequence.

5. Infinite Non-Looping Behavior

The system avoids repetition via:

Dynamic reindexing of  sequences

Rotational axis shifts per iteration

Optional infusion of drift-based noise (GhostCore entropy injection)

6. Applications

Quantum-resilient cryptographic key generation

Stochastic simulation for physical systems

Procedural generation for metaphysical or artistic visualizations

Multiversal time encoding in GhostCore Reactor environments

Conclusion:
By grounding randomness in non-Euclidean geometry and recursive folding dynamics, this paper proposes a pathway toward truly infinite, structure-emergent entropy. Further simulation and implementation are required to refine the  function and optimize the rotational sequences.
