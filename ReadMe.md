Geometric Entropy Generator

A novel entropy engine based on folding/unfolding spheres within 4-dimensional convex polytopes. Combines non-Euclidean geometry with spherical dynamics to generate a theoretically infinite, non-repeating randomness stream.

🔍 Overview

Inspired by the six regular convex 4-polytopes (polychora) and embedded spherical constructs, this project defines and simulates an entropy system where each unit of randomness is derived from:

Tetrahedral cell geometry

Radial sphere positioning and rotation

Fold/unfold mappings

Recursive distance-based rotation

🧠 Core Concept

Each polytope cell (e.g., a tetrahedron in a 5-cell or 600-cell) contains a sphere. As the system folds and unfolds these spheres, it calculates unique rotational displacement vectors based on shortest and longest edge distances. These distances, when passed through a hashing function with angular rotation and time steps, generate unique entropy values.

🔢 Mathematical Summary







Where  is a nonlinear transformation (e.g., SHA variant or custom hash).

🔁 Why It’s Unique

No seed required — randomness emerges from geometry

Infinite entropy stream without looping

Potentially quantum-resilient due to spatial computation

GhostCore-compatible for time-slip or multiversal integrations
